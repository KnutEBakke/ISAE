Clash of Particles!

This C project simulates particles enclosed in a box. The environment is frictionless and with each particle initialised with a velocity and a direction, the clash of particles may begin.

Enjoy!

PS: Use the Valgrind Version (t_max = 10) when running clash of particles with Valgrind, else it will be quite the wait. 
PPS: You should also change the range of the for-loop in test-heap-complexity.c to 120000 instead of 12000000 before running it with Valgrind.
PPPS: If you want to test with a different number of particles, using the write-doc command may save you some time.
